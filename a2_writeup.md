## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
    Some difficulties I had while completing the match function was working with loops and making sure they would stop at the right time. Another difficulty was dealing with what would happen if a source finishes before the pattern.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
    The match function can help with pulling out relevant parts from a database and pull out stuff like names, years, and genres.
